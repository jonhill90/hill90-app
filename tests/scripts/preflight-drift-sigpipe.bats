# The drift report must not kill the deploy.
#
# scripts/preflight-checkout.sh runs `set -euo pipefail` and printed the
# not-yet-deployed commits as:
#
#     git --no-pager log --oneline HEAD..origin/main | sed 's/^/    /' | head -20
#
# `head -20` closes the pipe after twenty lines. The writer upstream then takes
# SIGPIPE, `pipefail` promotes that to the pipeline's status (141), and `set -e`
# exits the script. Because the preflight runs in an `&&` chain BEFORE
# `git reset --hard origin/main`, the deploy stops there: nothing is deployed,
# and the host keeps running the old image.
#
# It is latent until the checkout falls more than twenty commits behind, which
# is why deploys worked for days and then stopped. Observed in production on
# 2026-08-03, deploying `api`:
#
#     # DRIFT: this checkout is 55 commits behind origin/main
#     ...twenty commit lines...
#     ##[error]Process completed with exit code 141.
#
# The fix is to ask git for the cap (`-n 20`) instead of closing a pipe on it,
# so no writer is ever signalled.
#
# This test does not depend on pipe-buffer timing — with only fifty-five short
# lines the whole output fits in the 64 KiB pipe buffer and the race may not
# fire at all. It uses a stub `git` that emits far more than a buffer's worth
# unless it is asked for a limit, which makes the old code fail every time and
# the new code pass every time.
