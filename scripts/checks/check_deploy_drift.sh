# Is the host's CHECKOUT the same as what was MERGED?
#
# NOT "is what is running the same as what was merged" — that is the question
# worth answering and this cannot answer it. It compares one git SHA read from
# the host against origin/main. A deploy resets the whole checkout and rebuilds
# ONE stack, so a service can be running code several commits older than the
# checkout reports. On 2026-08-03 this printed "what is running is what was
# merged" while two merged api fixes sat in the checkout and outside the running
# image — the guard making exactly the overclaim it was built to catch (#158).
#
# The wording below therefore states what was compared AND what was not. That is
# weaker than the sentence it replaces, and the weakness is the true reading:
# the fix is to compare more (per-service build provenance, #158), not to word
# the current comparison more confidently.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-08-03 a fix for an anonymous information leak
# (#136) was merged at 18:07 and did not reach production until 18:30. In
# between, two defects in the deploy path (#137, #139) each failed the deploy,
# and nothing anywhere said the fix was not running. It could not have: every
# health check answers from the running container, so they all reported the OLD
# code as healthy — correctly. `hill90.com` was up. `api.hill90.com/health`
# returned 200. The platform's PublicSiteDown and TenantApiDown were both quiet
# and both right.
#
# The only reason it surfaced is that a human curled one specific endpoint from
# outside, repeatedly. That is luck, not a control. This is the control.
#
# WHY NOT SIMPLY `deployed != main`. Because in this repository drift is the
# NORMAL state, measured before writing this: 32 commits landed on main in 24
# hours against 7 deploys. Deploys are workflow_dispatch by design (invariant 7:
# a merge must not deploy). An alarm on any difference would be red permanently
# and ignored inside a day, which is worse than no alarm — it teaches people the
# red is meaningless.
#
# So it alarms on the difference that can actually hurt:
#
#   1. undeployed commits touching DEPLOYABLE paths — a docs commit that has
#      not shipped is not an outage, a services/ commit that has not shipped
#      may be one;
#   2. that have been waiting longer than a grace window — a deploy takes
#      minutes and nobody deploys on every merge, so recent drift is expected;
#   3. or ANY commit on the host that is not on main — that direction is never
#      normal. It means someone edited production, and `git reset --hard` is
#      about to destroy it.
#
# THE THIRD EXIT CODE IS THE POINT. If the deployed SHA cannot be determined,
# this exits 2 and says so. It does not pass. An assertion that succeeds on
# absence is the failure mode this estate has hit five times, most recently in
# `vault.sh assert-unsealed` — a check that cannot see the thing is not evidence
# the thing is fine.
#
# This runs on the RUNNER, against this repository's checkout, and is given the
# host's SHA as an input. It deliberately does NOT run from the host's copy:
# that is the bootstrap deadlock of #139, where the guard is read from the very
# checkout it is meant to be judging.
#
# Usage:
#   DEPLOYED_SHA=<sha> bash scripts/checks/check_deploy_drift.sh
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  no actionable drift  (in sync, docs-only, or inside the grace window)
#   1  ACTIONABLE DRIFT     (deployable code merged and not running, or host ahead)
#   2  CANNOT DETERMINE     (no usable deployed SHA — never silent, never green)
